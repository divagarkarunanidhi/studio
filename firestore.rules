/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Defect Insights Dashboard.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for defects, domains, reporters, and assignees,
 * where users can create, read, update, and delete their own data. Public read access is allowed for
 * defects, but only the uploader can modify or delete them. This promotes collaboration while
 * maintaining data integrity and security. The user collection is secured for the owner.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user-specific data.
 * - /defects/{defectId}: Stores defect information, including an `uploaderId` field for ownership.
 * - /domains/{domainId}: Stores domain information.
 * - /reporters/{reporterId}: Stores reporter information.
 * - /assignees/{assigneeId}: Stores assignee information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own user data.
 * - Defects are publicly readable, but only the uploader can modify them.
 * - Domains, reporters, and assignees are only manageable by their owner.
 * - Data validation is minimal for rapid prototyping, focusing on authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `defects` collection includes an `uploaderId` field to track ownership. This allows for efficient
 *   authorization checks without requiring additional reads.
